Issue Beaver
============

**This is work in progress**

**Issue Beaver** scans your project's source code for comments containing *TODO*.

**Issue Beaver** automatically creates new issues on Github for each TODO comment it finds.

**Issue Beaver** automatically closes issues on Github when you remove a TODO comment.

The goal is to provide simple and lightweight tracking of low-level technical issues (TODOs) and make the project's progress more transparent for people who don't want to read the source code.
